        Welcome to the development page. This is were I talk about
        the development process of the game. There was many steps and
        hoops that I do go through in order to find the best way
        to build the first prototype of the game. The game is build in
        Unity and the first prototype has been build and texted 
        within 10 weeks.

        Since my idea was to go with an isometric look and feel for
        the game I had to decide how to build the game. Do I build 
        the game in a 2D environment and add sprites and flat elements
        that are build to look like a 3D element or do I decide to 
        build everything in 3D and find the best possible 
        camera and view angle to show an isomentric view.
        I decided to go with a 3D environment because I would find 
        it easier to build my environement in a 3D view. The biggest
        challenge was to find the right angle for the camera to look
        at the scene.

            <p class="ntext">
              The lighting of the game plays a big impact on the look and feel
              of the game. The aesthetic changes with a dark or light theme
              so I did the only thing I could: I build one option first and
              tested to see if the option has to even be build. I started 
              by creating the scene in a very light environment with a white
              background and blue main characters but red resources. The game
              is easily understood in testing but I do what build the dark 
              themed version of it and see what kind of effect it would
              have on the overall effect. I just want to flip the switch!

      <p class="ntext">
        Now the mechanics. You have to connect the dots.
        I did base the game on a simple idea: 
        Overpopulation and food distribution. But how is this shown
        in a mechanic that drives a game?! I started building each
        element on its own and thought about how they interact with
        one another. After adding script after script I ended up
        with a scene where all elements are somehow interacting with
        one another. I will continue to improve these interactions
        to build the best systematic game possible.
