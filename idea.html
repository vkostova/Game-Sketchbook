    <h1 class="title">THE IDEA</h1>

    
    <div> <p class="ntext">The game I want to create is about 
      <span class="underline" "ntext"> wastefulness</span> 
      and how ones 
      <span class="underline" "ntext"> actions can influence your environment. </span>
        Currently, I am thinking 
      about distribution of food supplies and how they can be wasted 
      or not distributed equally. I want the player to have a growing 
      population that needs to be taken care of but problems will 
      arise with the increasing amount of people and the resources 
      that are needed to take care of everybody. I would like the 
      player to have a 
      <span class="underline" "ntext">hard time deciding </span>
        what choice to make. 
      Like the game "Papers, Please!" I want the player to make 
      difficult decisions which do not promise a good outcome every time.

    <div> <p class="ntext">As mentioned before I find inspiration 
      in the game 
      <a href="https://papersplea.se">Papers, Please!</a>. The difficult choices made 
      within the game are something I want to achieve as well. 
      The 
      <a href="https://playkids.ch/presskit/">interactive short movie and game </a>
      by Michael Frei, a Swiss filmmaker and artist, is one of the inspirations 
      for the game that is going to be developed. The minimalistic design 
      and interactivity are what I find interesting and would like 
      to take into considerations for my prototypes. 
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaY5_dzpqpQ&feature=emb_logo">Flow</a> 
      is a game about growing by collecting. I find this mechanic interesting 
      because I am playing with the idea of using it for my game 
      by growing the number of people by collecting them during 
      the game.
      <br><br>
      The aesthetic that I found a liking to was isometric so I had to 
      think about how to get away from a flat design and into a more
      three-dimensional design. Somewhere in between. 2.5. 
      <br><br>
      So I started experimenting with unity and viewpoints.

  <p class="ntext">The aesthetic goal for this game is meant 
    to be very simple. I want the player to be able to focus and 
    fully experience the main mechanic of the game without being 
    distracted by non-essential elements. <br><br>The beginning of the 
    game the environment will be as empty as possible. Only the 
    player character and interactive elements like the resources 
    will be visible. As the player progresses through the level 
    I want the environment to fill more and more but again only 
    with a growing population (clones of the main character) and 
    growing resources (clones of resources). The whole game will 
    be build with these two main elements. I am considering to 
    change the color of the different resources in order to introduce 
    more colors into the game.<br><br>I am hoping to create a focused 
    vision with these elements and allow the players to understand 
    how the mechanic works through a playful way, because I want 
    to refrain from giving any tutorials or explanations. 
    The player will be thrown into the game without knowing 
    anything but due to the lack of elements (at least in the 
    beginning) I want to allow for a slow process of understanding.
